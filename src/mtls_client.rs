//! Client-side half of the platform's internal mutual TLS.
//!
//! The internal gRPC servers (ais_auth, ais_secretserver, RunpodManager,
//! keystore, domain_management) *require* a client certificate signed by the
//! internal CA. This is the matching helper for anything that dials them.
//!
//! This is a vendored file -- the same text lives in every crate that dials an
//! mTLS server, exactly like the `.proto` files did before `ais_proto`, because
//! `artisan_middleware`'s `mtls` module is deliberately tonic-free (each crate
//! pins its own tonic). Keep the copies identical; the canonical source is
//! `ais_proto/mtls_client.rs.tmpl`.
//!
//! Behaviour is chosen by the address scheme, so one binary works in both
//! worlds without a flag:
//!   * `https://host:port` -> mutual TLS. Requires client certificate material;
//!     the server's certificate is verified against the internal CA and
//!     against `server_name` (the leaf certs carry a DNS SAN equal to the
//!     service name the CA tool was given, e.g. `ais_auth`).
//!   * `http://host:port`  -> plaintext. Local development against a server
//!     that is itself running without TLS only; a production mTLS server will
//!     refuse it.
//!
//! No `tracing`/`log` dependency on purpose: errors are returned as `String`
//! for the caller to log with whatever it already uses.

// Vendored into several crates, each of which uses only part of it.
